  <h1>Wheat Fields With Crows</h1>
  <p>The menacing, stormy sky, the crows and a path apparently leading nowhere have all been read as hints of his suicide. In reality, he completed several more paintings after this one. Whatâ€™s more, Van Gogh was seeking to express something positive and comforting in this work: the overpowering gloom emphasizes the grandeur and magnificence of the landscape.</p>
