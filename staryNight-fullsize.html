  <h1>Starry Night</h1>
  <p>The Starry Night is an oil on canvas by van Gogh. Painted in June, 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an idealized village. It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. It is regarded as among Van Gogh's finest works and one of the most recognized monuments in the history of Western culture.</p>
